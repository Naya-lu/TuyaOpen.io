## Software Build Configuration

The board-level configuration file defines parameters for core functional components such as peripheral drivers, pin mapping, BSP packages, and third-party libraries. By using the pre-configured board-level configuration file provided with the development board, you can significantly reduce the workload of hardware adaptation and driver development, thus improving development efficiency.

:::tip Want to develop new peripherals?
**Config Features:**
- **If you need to add new peripherals, you can write drivers directly at the application layer.** BSP drivers are mainly for onboard fixed peripherals.
- Peripheral requirements may vary between applications, so you may need to adjust the config file according to your specific needs.
- Different application requirements may require configuring different third-party library parameters.
- <span style={{color: 'red'}}><strong>It is recommended</strong> to use the provided initial Config file as the basis for board-level configuration</span>, and then perform secondary development and feature expansion on this basis.

### Hardware Architecture Diagram
![T5-AI Core Hardware Diagram](/img/hardware-specific/t5-ai-core/t5ai-core-hardware-diagram-v101.jpg)

### Design Philosophy & Pin Availability

The T5AI-Core development board was designed with both portability and development flexibility in mind. Only core functional modules such as `battery power supply`, `firmware burning and debugging`, and `audio input/output` are integrated onboard, ensuring the board is ready to use out of the box and meets the needs of main voice interaction scenarios.

Except for these core functions, all other functional pins are fully broken out via the 44-pin header, greatly enhancing hardware expandability and accessibility. Developers can flexibly connect various external sensors, actuators, or other peripherals according to project needs, making prototyping and feature validation much easier. This design not only ensures a simple and efficient board structure but also provides a solid hardware foundation for future feature expansion and custom development. For more IO requirements, the PCB also reserves pad test points, giving the board comprehensive expansion capabilities while maintaining a compact size.
