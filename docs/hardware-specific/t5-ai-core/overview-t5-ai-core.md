### Design Philosophy and Pin Availability

The T5AI-Core development board was designed from the beginning to balance portability and development flexibility. The board only integrates core functional modules such as `battery power`, `firmware programming and debugging`, and `audio input/output`, ensuring the development board is **ready to use out of the box and can meet the needs of main application scenarios like voice interaction**.

Beyond these core functions, all other functional pins are fully exposed through 44-pin headers, significantly enhancing hardware expandability and accessibility. Developers can flexibly connect various external sensors, actuators, or other peripherals according to actual project needs, greatly facilitating prototype development and functional verification. This design not only ensures the development board structure is simple and efficient, but also provides a solid hardware foundation for subsequent function expansion and custom development. For additional IO interface needs, the PCB surface also reserves solder pad test points, maintaining the development board's compact size while providing comprehensive expansion capabilities.

#### Charging Indicator LED Logic
The ETA6003 battery management chip controls the charging indicator LED (Charge LED) to display current charging status. Its operation logic is as follows:

- When the toggle switch is set to "On" position, the Power indicator LED lights up, indicating the system is powered on.
- **Charging**: When the lithium battery is charging, Charge LED will light up, indicating the system is in charging state.
- **Fully Charged**: When the lithium battery is fully charged, Charge LED will automatically turn off, indicating charging is complete.
- **No Battery Connected or No Charging**: Charge LED remains in blinking state.

> **Note**: To determine charging status, observe whether the Charge LED on the development board is lit.
