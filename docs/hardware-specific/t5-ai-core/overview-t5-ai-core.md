## Software Build Configuration

The board-level configuration file defines parameters for core components such as peripheral drivers, pin mapping, BSP packages, and third-party libraries defines flags. By using the pre-configured board-level configuration file provided with the development board, you can significantly reduce the workload for hardware adaptation and driver development, improving development efficiency.

:::tip Want to develop new peripherals?
**Config Features:**
- **If you need to add new peripherals, you can write drivers directly at the application layer.** BSP drivers are mainly for onboard fixed peripherals.
- Peripheral requirements may vary between applications, so you may need to adjust the config file accordingly.
- Different application needs may require different third-party library parameters.
- <span style={{color: 'red'}}><strong>It is recommended</strong> to use the provided initial Config file as the base for board-level configuration</span> and extend or modify it as needed for your project.

### Hardware Architecture Diagram
![T5-AI Core Hardware Diagram](/img/hardware-specific/t5-ai-core/t5ai-core-hardware-diagram-v101.jpg)

### Design Philosophy & Pin Availability

The T5AI-Core development board is designed with both portability and development flexibility in mind. Only essential modules such as `battery power`, `firmware burning and debugging`, and `audio input/output` are integrated onboard, ensuring the board is ready to use out of the box for main voice interaction scenarios.

All other functional pins are fully broken out via a 44-pin header, greatly enhancing hardware expandability and accessibility. Developers can flexibly connect various external sensors, actuators, or other peripherals according to project needs, making prototyping and feature validation much easier. This design not only keeps the board structure simple and efficient but also provides a solid hardware foundation for future expansion and customization. For additional IO needs, test pads are reserved on the PCB, giving the board comprehensive expansion capabilities while maintaining a compact size.

## Hardware Details

### Power Management System

#### Power Inputs
- **Type-C USB 2.0 Port**: Provides 5V main power input and supports USB DP/DN data communication.
- **PH2.0 Battery Connector**: Supports 3.7V lithium battery input for portable applications.

#### Power Management IC
- **ETA6003 Battery Management IC**:
  - Accepts 5V from Type-C USB and 3.7V from the battery connector.
  - Manages battery charging and power distribution.
  - Outputs 5V to the power switch.
  - Controls the power indicator (PW LED) and charging indicator (Charge LED).

#### Power Switch & Regulation
- **Power Switch**: Controls the main system voltage (VSYS), receiving 5V from the ETA6003.
- **LN2220PAR Boost Module**: Boosts VSYS to a stable 5V power domain for high-power components like the audio amplifier.
- **RY3408 3.3V Regulator**: Steps down the boosted 5V to 3.3V for the T5-E1 module and digital circuits.

#### Power Features
- Dual power input: USB 5V and lithium battery 3.7V

- Multi-stage regulation, providing stable 5V and 3.3V power domains
- Low-power design, suitable for portable applications

:::warning Battery Requirements
- **Battery Type**: 3.7V lithium battery recommended, with a discharge rate of at least 1C to ensure stable system power.
- **Capacity Recommendation**: Choose a suitable capacity based on your application, typically 500mAh~2000mAh.
- **Polarity Warning**: Connect the battery strictly according to the positive/negative markings to avoid damage from reverse connection.
- **Protection Circuit**: It is recommended to use batteries with overcharge, over-discharge, and short-circuit protection for safety.

#### Charging Indicator Logic

The ETA6003 battery management IC controls the charging indicator (Charge LED) to show the current charging status. The logic is as follows:

- When the power switch is set to "On", the Power LED lights up, indicating the system is powered.
- **Charging**: When the lithium battery is charging, the Charge LED lights up, indicating charging is in progress.
- **Fully Charged**: When charging is complete, the Charge LED turns off.
